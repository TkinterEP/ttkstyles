# ttkstyles
Do you like [ttkthemes](https://github.com/TkinterEP/ttkthemes), but 
don't quite enjoy having all sorts of themes installed when you only
need just the one? Would you like to be able to easily use different
fonts in your application without having to load them yourself?

Well, now you can! Or at least, almost. This repository is a WIP to 
replace `ttkthemes`. It allows you to define the style of your
application in a CSS-like format. Themes can be pulled from many places,
such as GitHub. This separates the themes from the repository, allowing
people to make popular themes while the loading mechanism is maintained
separately.

## How to use
For now, just have a look at `example.py` and `example.ttkstyle` to find 
out how to use this first version of the project. More detailed 
documentation is not high on the priority list while the outline of 
the project is still changing.
